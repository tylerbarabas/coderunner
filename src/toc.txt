iv) Waiver: The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this agreement shall not affect in any way the first party's right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision in this agreement shall not be taken or held by the other party to be a continuing waiver of that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.

v) Feedback to COMPANY:

You agreed and acknowledge that all suggestions, comments, ideas, and improvements You offer to COMPANY regarding the Website or any of COMPANY's Services are "works made for hire" for the benefit of COMPANY and You assign all right, title and interest in such to COMPANY.
